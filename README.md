# How To Scale Your Model

ScaleOps is a repository dedicated to collecting and sharing findings from exploring and optimizing the scalability and performance of AI workloads.

The website is available at https://tomaslaz.github.io/scale-ops.

### Acknowledgments

The website uses a Distill-style Jekyll theme created by https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio and the Distill team.

This project was inspired by the [How to Scale Your Model](https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/) book by the JAX-ML team and shamelessly reuses their setup and some of their ideas.
